For men suffering from gynecomastia, the problem is often more serious than an aesthetic concern. Many males with gynecomastia, especially teens, suffer from low self-esteem, anxiety and even depression due to the condition. They may avoid engaging in activities that require them to take off their shirts, including swimming or lounging on the beach.</p>

                          <p><strong>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui </strong>recognizes that gynecomastia can negatively impact individuals&rsquo; emotional wellbeing. The good news is that he offers males in Casablanca male breast reduction surgery, or gynecomastia treatment. Male breast reduction is designed to sculpt the chest area, improving the contour of overly large male breasts. Treating gynecomastia does wonders to improve male patients&rsquo; self-esteem and confidence, as well as their overall quality of life.</p>
                          <p>Often, the onset of gynecomastia occurs during adolescence and may resolve on its own. However, in some cases gynecomastia can persist into adulthood, or develop with advanced age. Gynecomastia is most commonly caused by hormonal fluctuations. In addition, the ongoing use of certain medications (e.g., steroids) can stimulate hormonal changes that cause gynecomastia. Chronic use of certain drugs such as marijuana can also cause the development of gynecomastia, as can major weight fluctuations.</p>

                         <p>Most boys enter puberty between the ages of 11 through 14. At this time, there is a huge increase in their natural production of testosterone and, to a much lesser degree, estrogen&hellip;</p>
                          <p>Gynecomastia is both a benign and cosmetic condition that has profound effects on the psychosocial development of any young teenager. <strong>Dr. Sefrioui</strong> understands and wants to help all the young teens that have gone through shame, bullying, and embarrassing remarks throughout their social settings.</p>
                          <p><strong><h6>WHAT IS ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIA ?</h6></strong></p>
                          <p>Nearly half of teenage boys, typically between the ages of 11 through 14, struggle with <strong>gynecomastia</strong> (male breast enlargement) for years with negative body-image issues and are often horrified, ashamed, and afraid of outside ridicule. Although the exact development of <strong>gynecomastia</strong> is unknown, certainly hormones play a great part. There are of course hereditary factors at play as well&hellip;</p>
                          <p>A young teen will typically experience an increase in the natural production of testosterone along with changes in their estrogen levels during puberty. This &ldquo;imbalance&rdquo; of estrogen and testosterone or whether the small amount of innate breast tissue, which is naturally present in every male, is just extraordinarily sensitive to such hormonal changes.</p>
                          <p><strong>Gynecomastia</strong> in young teens can appear and go away in as little as a few months to a year; however, in many cases the glandular tissue will continue to grow and become permanent. It has been estimated that more than one-third of the male population has some degree of gynecomastia, most of which occurred during puberty.</p>
                          <p><strong><h6>THE EFFECTS OF GYNECOMASTIA ON ADOLESCENTS</h6></strong></p>
                          <p>Many young teens walk &ldquo;hunched&rdquo; over or wear various layers of shirts to hide their <strong>gynecomastia</strong>. They also refuse to even participate in sports or other social activities, specifically going to the gym, or a public beach or pool. Dr. Sefrioui has had patients that decided they were better off deliberately becoming obese because it was more acceptable to be overweight than to have enlarged breasts.</p>
                          <p>These young men tend to suffer in silence and are typically afraid to even bring the issue to up their parents. Dr. Sefrioui requires all patients under the age of 18 to get permission from their parents in order to have their consultation, which is a difficult first step for them. No young man should have a crushed self-esteem because of <strong>gynecomastia</strong> !</p>
                          <p><strong><h6>THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO A PARENT :</h6></strong></p>
                          <ul>
                          <li>All boys will go through puberty ! Their bodies are changing and their hormones are going all over the place. If your son approaches you to discuss his body and emotions, please do not brush him off !</li>
                          <li>If he does not say anything to you, then you need to reach out and talk to him. Let him know that you are there for him and he can count on your support.</li>
                          <li><strong>Gynecomastia</strong> will NOT go away with diet and exercise ! Telling him to watch what he eats and trying to motivate him into going to the gym will not solve the underlying issue.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>My advice is to wait it out for at least six months to a year to see if it goes away on its own. If its persistent or continues to grow, then his only option is to get the surgery.</p>
                          <p><br /><br /></p>
                          <p><strong><h6>MY APPROACH TO ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIA</h6></strong></p>
                          <p><strong> Many doctors will say &ndash; &ldquo;wait it out until you are 18 years old.&rdquo;</strong></p>
                          <p>This is an unacceptable answer, especially if the boy is between 11 and 14 years old and has had gynecomastia present for more than a year. There is no reason for a young teenager to suffer through their remaining teenage years in hopes of it disappearing when it will not.</p>
                          <p>The best thing to do is get the surgery. A young teenage man needs this time in their life to build their self-confidence and social skills. <strong>Gynecomastia</strong> is purely physical, glandular tissue and/or fat, but the psychological treatment itself is way more important.</p>
                          <p><strong> I want all of my young teen patients to have that weight lifted off their chest.</strong></p>
                          <p>I&rsquo;ve performed surgery on young teens to promote a healthy and emotional maturity of their teenage years. The entire procedure is performed under local anesthesia, within <strong>Dr. Sefrioui&rsquo;s </strong>private, clean and comfortable medical facility. The entire surgery can take 1-3 hours to perform, depending if the patient requires just an excision, VaserLipo or a combination of both procedures, and if the patient has gynecomastia on one side vs. Both sides.</p>
                          <p><strong><h6>WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER YOUNG TEEN GYNECOMASTIA SURGERY?</h6></strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Dr. Sefrioui </strong>wants all his <strong>Gynecomastia</strong> patients to have <strong>CLOSURE</strong>, for both physical and psychological reasons. He will personally communicate with each teen patient and gives complete instructions to help speed their recovery. All of his patients immediately change their posture and overall attitude once the gland is removed.</p>
                          <p>They have more self-confidence, can&rsquo;t wait to wear form-fitting clothing for the first time in years, and return back to the gym in order to get a more muscular physique.</p>
                          <p>Are you a young teenager experiencing <strong>Gynecomastia</strong> ? Discuss your concerns with your parents and pediatrician. Remember, if this is from puberty, it could go away in a couple of months or a year. If it persists for more than that, it could increase in size and surgery is your only option.

                                      <p>Many overweight or obese men are concerned about their breasts and seek evaluation and treatment for their gynecomastia. When treating these men, a very careful physical examination&hellip;</p>
                <p>Just like adolescent gynecomastia, adult gynecomastia is caused by an imbalance of the hormones testosterone and estrogen. Dr. Sefrioui understands that gynecomastia can cause embarrassment for males of all ages, especially adult men that want to wear form-fitting clothing and/or want to go shirtless at the public pool or beach. He is a cosmetic perfectionist that will remove, reshape and tighten unwanted fat and skin around your chest for that perfect &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; shape chest that all men want.</p>
                <p><strong><h6>WHAT IS ADULT GYNECOMASTIA ?</h6></strong></p>
                <p>Adult gynecomastia is swelling of the male breast tissue and/or combination of fat in the chest region. The actual occurrence of gynecomastia reaches its peak between the ages of 50 and 80. There are numerous potential causes of adult gynecomastia. However, recent medical research reveals that gynecomastia is most commonly caused by one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Adolescent gynecomastia persistent : 25%</li>
                <li>Drug induced : 10 &ndash; 25%</li>
                <li>No detectable cause : 25%</li>
                <li>Malnutrition and liver disease : 8 %</li>
                <li>Primary hypogonadism (deficient testes): 8%</li>
                <li>Tumors of the testes: 3%</li>
                <li>Secondary hypogonadism (low sperm count): 2%</li>
                <li>Hypothyroidism: 1.5%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, 25% of the gynecomastia cases are typically unresolved from adolescence ! And most of you were told &ndash; &ldquo;<strong>Just wait it out&hellip; It will go away</strong>.&rdquo; Remember that ?</p>
                <p><strong><h6>THE EFFECTS OF GYNECOMASTIA ON ADULT MEN</h6></strong></p>
                <p>Do you recall your parents or a doctor ever telling you that it will go away with diet and exercise ?</p>
                <p><strong>But you still have it</strong>&hellip; Thousands of men over the age of 18, in great shape or overweight, are concerned about their breasts and seek evaluation and treatment of their gynecomastia. Some men are content with their weight and simply want to reduce the size of their breasts, while others want to lose weight but their breasts cause too much embarrassment ; which prevent them from even entering a gym.</p>
                <p>Gynecomastia did its job&hellip; It was in the back of their mind ever since they were a young teen.</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO AN ADULT</strong></p>
                <p>The social effects of gynecomastia have already occurred but you can still increase your self-esteem and get motivated by getting the surgery. Most male gynecomastia patients that are evaluated by Dr. Sefrioui, have a combination of fatty and glandular tissue. These patients will need both liposuction and the removal of the glandular tissue to provide the best contour throughout the chest area. This will remove all the excess breast tissue and result in a flat, more muscular chest.</p>
                <p>I highly recommend that all my adult patients :</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Follow a strict diet</li>
                <li>Join and routinely visit a gym</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is far better to operate on adult men who are at their best and most comfortable weight &ndash; they are also healthier as well!</p>
                <p><strong><h6>MY APPROACH TO ADULT GYNECOMASTIA</h6></strong></p>
                <p>There is a big difference in comparing an adult with glandular tissue vs a combination of glandular tissue and fat. Gynecomastia in an overweight or obese male has breast tissue concentrated under the nipple, which extends outward into the surrounding fat. The removal of just the gland is not enough. As weight is lost, the breasts will droop due to loose skin which cannot tighten by itself due to the loss of elasticity. The nipples will frequently be too low on the chest as well.</p>
                <p>Dr. Sefrioui uses his <strong>Vaser Hi-Def PowerX LipoSculpting</strong> and years of experience to remove gynecomastia from adults that have glandular tissue and/or a combination of fat. The Hi-Def, Vaser Lipo is a sophisticated liposuction technique that uses ultrasound energy to selectively target unwanted fat deposits for smooth, extraordinary results with fast recovery and minimal downtime.</p>
                <p>The entire procedure is performed under local anesthesia. You will be awake during the entire procedure, fully relaxed with no pain ! The entire surgery can take 1-3 hours to perform, depending if you require just an excision, Vaser Lipo or a combination of both procedures, and if you have gynecomastia on one side (unilateral) vs. Both sides (bilateral).</p>
                <p><strong><h6>WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER YOUR GYNECOMASTIA SURGERY</h6></strong></p>
                <p>Dr. Sefrioui has over 13 years of experience specializing in gynecomastia and other cosmetic procedures. He recognizes that male Gynecomastia can cause feelings of embarrassment and awkwardness for men, difficulties in wearing form fitting shirts for adults and a distraction from a chiseled and sculpted chest on body builders. Dr. Sefrioui wants all his Gynecomastia patients to have <strong>CLOSURE</strong>.</p>
                <p>The final results of your <strong>VaserLipo Gynecomastia</strong> procedure are permanent, the fat and gland will not return ! As mentioned above, Dr. Sefrioui does encourages a healthy lifestyle of diet and exercise to supplement and maintain this cosmetic procedure.</p>

                      <h3>PUFFY NIPPLES </h3>
                      <hr class="divider-custom hr-sm-left-2 text-java">
                      <div class="offset-top-60"><img src="images/men/puffynipple.jpg" width="870" height="440" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
                        <div class="offset-top-30" style="text-align:justify;">
                         <p>Men with puffy nipples are typically in very good physical shape. While puffy nipple is of the major concern, there are many other aspects that absolutely need to be addressed in order to not only&hellip;</p>
                          <p>Puffy Nipples&rdquo; are the most common forms of gynecomastia. This gland and/or adipose tissue can be located directly under the areola or can be slightly extended outside the areola, causing the areola to appear dome shaped. This form of Gynecomastia can be found in all age groups but is more common in young adults.</p>
                          <p>There are many ways teens and men try to deal with this issue, from shrugging their shoulders, wearing compression shirts or multiple shirts, to stimulating them to contract or worst of all, using tape to cover them. These are all temporary solutions to a problem that can only be solved with gynecomastia surgery.</p>
                          <p>Dr. Sefrioui will determine if you are a suitable candidate for male breast reduction by glandular excision and/or VaserLipo. Dr. Sefrioui is well-versed in gynecomastia and can determine if there is firm breast tissue beneath the areola that is causing the nipples to project (which is often the case), and if so, how much of this glandular tissue can be removed to create a flat appearance.</p>
                          <p>Puffy nipple surgery generally takes only an hour or two, and the recovery time is short; sometimes less than a week. There is minimal scarring and the success rate is excellent. Therefore, patients who suffer from &ldquo;Puffy Nipples&rdquo;, and who view it as an unaesthetic and unpleasant condition, may desire glandular removal to correct the &ldquo;puffy nipple&rdquo; condition.</p>
                          <p>Men who suffer from large areolas may notice that after breast surgery, the skin of the chest muscles will tighten, causing the areolas to tighten and diminish in size. This is a result of the removal of glandular and/or adipose tissue.</p>
                          <p>More importantly, when the excess glandular or adipose tissue is removed, the patient is able to resume life with a new and improved physique without the worry that gynecomastia will return.</p>
                          <p>Dr. Sefrioui is keenly aware of the results that can be attained through corrective surgery. A consultation with Dr. Sefrioui is recommended in order that your condition be evaluated and your questions and concerns about surgery can be addressed.</p>

                      <h3>REVISION SURGERY </h3>
                      <hr class="divider-custom hr-sm-left-2 text-java">
                      <div class="offset-top-60"><img src="images/men/revisionsurgery.jpg" width="870" height="440" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
                        <div class="offset-top-30" style="text-align:justify;">
                          <p>In some cases, an unsatisfactory result from prior gynecomastia surgery must be corrected through revision surgery. Gynecomastia surgery is a complex procedure that requires great surgical skill. When performed by an inexperienced doctor, the outcome of the surgery may be less than ideal.</p>
                          <p>Even when working with an experienced doctor, problems may arise during surgery or during the recover process, especially if patients do not follow their surgeon&rsquo;s post-operative instructions. In some cases, a dis-satisfactory result may occur as a result of a miscommunication between the patient and doctor. In such cases, revision surgery may be able to correct or improve the results of the original gynecomastia surgery.</p>
                          <p>When a patient is considering revision surgery, Dr. Sefrioui will make a careful evaluation of the existing problems and create a unique operative plan to address them. He always takes the time to thoroughly explain the process to his patients so they will have realistic expectations for the outcome of their revision surgery. Before agreeing to perform the surgery, Dr. Sefrioui ensures that the patient understands the level of improvement that the surgery can offer.</p>
                          <p>Perfection is rarely attainable through revision gynecomastia surgery, but a number of advanced techniques allow Dr. Sefrioui to offer his patients a reasonable amount of improvement.</p>
                          <p>Revision surgery is typically performed under a combination of conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Dr. Sefrioui will choose from a variety of surgical techniques to correct any remaining gynecomastia and improve the appearance of your chest area. In cases where the breast tissue was not sufficiently reduced during the first surgery, he may remove the excess tissue through surgical excision or liposuction of the chest area. As with the primary surgery, incisions are typically concealed in the lower half of the nipple area. If the complaints include uneven skin texture or irregular deposits of fat, he will work to address these during the surgery as well.</p>
                          <p>Most patients are able to return home the same day as their procedure. Pain levels will vary between individuals, with pain usually lasting between three days and two weeks. Most patients also experience some amount of swelling and bruising, which can be minimized by wearing a compression bandage provided by our doctor. Most men are able to return to work within one week, but this time-frame will vary based upon the revisions being made and the individual&rsquo;s work duties (strenuous work must be avoided for longer).</p>
                          <p>Patients must avoid any lifting, pulling, or pushing motions for six weeks following their surgery. Dr. Sefrioui provides his patients with a specific set of instructions to follow during the recovery period. Careful adherence to these instructions will help ensure a positive outcome after the surgery.</p>
                          <p>If you are considering gynecomastia surgery or require revision surgery, it is important to understand that the results of the surgery are dependent upon many factors. Perhaps most importantly, the surgery should be performed by a skilled and experienced surgeon who specializes in gynecomastia surgery. Dr. Sefrioui, who is highly experienced in gynecomastia surgery is able to anticipate and prevent most common problems.

                          <p><strong><h6>BODY BUILDER GYNECOMASTIA SURGERY :</h6></strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Male breast reduction surgery for bodybuilders is very similar to the standard procedure. However, the actual breast tissue itself is much different. Steroid-induced gynecomastia is&hellip;</strong></p>
                          <p>Bodybuilders are a unique subset of patients with gynecomastia, since their gynecomastia is usually small (confined to the area just under the areola) and is largely due to self-medicating with hormones and anabolic steroids. For the most part, bodybuilders have very low percentages of body fat and are in excellent physical and nutritional shape.</p>
                          <p>Many of them have taken anabolic steroids without proper physician supervision. The obvious goal of these steroids is to help bulk up their muscles. Some men knowingly take anabolic steroids and then attempt to prevent the development of gynecomastia (a common and well known side effect) by self medicating themselves with other drugs to block the side effects of the steroids. This often becomes a circus of self prescribed medications, which can seriously disrupt one&rsquo;s delicate hormonal balance.</p>
                          <p>Some men do not specifically take anabolic steroids. But they may take &ldquo;protein supplements,&rdquo; prohormones and other seemingly harmless supplements, available at health food stores or through the internet. The problem is that many of the listed ingredients are not specific and these supplements may indeed have hormone-like qualities. The net effect is that gynecomastia may develop most unexpectedly and sometimes very quickly. And once it has developed, there are no treatments for it other than surgery.</p>
                          <p>The most visible side effect of anabolic steroids is the development of excess breast tissue (commonly called &ldquo;bitch tits&rdquo;). This is due to the conversion (termed aromatization) of the testosterone they have taken into estrogen. The estrogen, in turn, then promotes the growth of breast tissue. Bodybuilders complain mostly about very localized gynecomastia (just under or around the areola) and/or puffy nipples, although some very large growths of breast tissue have been encountered. When the pec muscle is flexed, the nipples protrude excessively and detract from the contour of the chest.</p>
                          <p>It is our strong professional opinion that tampering with one&rsquo;s delicately balanced hormonal system &ndash; particularly without appropriate physician supervision and blood testing &ndash; is totally inappropriate, dangerous to one&rsquo;s health and should not be done. Nevertheless, for those bodybuilders who have developed gynecomastia, appropriate surgery is the best answer. The surgery should provide for a flat nipple/areola on a contoured, muscular chest.</p>
                          <p><strong><h6>WHAT RESULTS CAN BE EXPECTED?</h6></strong></p>
                          <p>The results of gynecomastia surgery are usually permanent provided that additional illicit drugs are not used in the future. There is always a small amount of breast tissue deliberately left under the areola to prevent a crater deformity. Should additional drugs be taken in the future, it is that residual breast tissue that can conceivably re-grow again.</p>
