                          <p>Breast Surgery is one of the most important parts of my practice, it goes from breast reconstructions to breast augmentation. In fact, specifically in breast augmentation, we can distinguish between two different groups of patients.</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><strong>Patients unhappy with the size of their breast: </strong>They never developed and they've always wanted to have a fuller bust and more cleavage. For those patients, they need to think about breast augmentation. This procedure will enlarge and enhance the shape of their breast, we usually suggest breast enhancement with Fat transfer or augmentation using implants either silicone or saline.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                          <li><strong>Patients unhappy with the shape of their breasts: </strong>Although they may also be unhappy with the size of their breasts, their concern is with sagging, the shape or position of the nipple, and perhaps even unevenness .</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>This unevenness is very common. As we talk to patients about breast surgery we try to identify which problems they have and what they would like to improve.</p>
                          <p>If you are interested in cosmetic cosmetic surgery procedures such as a breast augmentation, fat grafting, breast augmentation without implants, breast lift, breast reduction, or breast reconstruction, please schedule a personal and confidential cosmetic surgery consultation with <strong>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> to discuss the best option for you.</p>

                       <p>Hormonal influences, the individual structural quality of the tissue, pregnancy and breastfeeding, gravity and personal lifestyle, natural ageing processes, etc. all are huge factors that play a decisive role in this respect. Small or sagging breasts make many women feel unfeminine and incomplete, reducing their sexual self-esteem.</p>
                        <p>Breast Augmentation is a surgical procedure to increase the size of breasts that are small and underdeveloped, or breasts that have decreased in size after childbearing or weight loss. Breast augmentation can reshape your breasts, improve your appearance and increase your self-confidence</p>
                        <p><strong>Beautiful, especially NATURALLY LOOKING and shaped breasts are two steps away from you!</strong></p>
                        <p>We have been working in the development of new techniques for correction of breast deformities. We offer the full range of procedures from fat grafting to the use of dermal matrix substitutes to implants to address the most complex deformities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> will restore your confidence and health from an earlier horrendous cosmetic surgery experience to give you back your <strong>CONFIDENCE</strong>, <strong>TRUST</strong> and <strong>SATISFACTION</strong> with a standard of cosmetic care. Which are mainly scarless procedures with satisfying results.</p>

                            <p>The FDA recently approved a new generation of silicone gel-filled breast implants, so now women have a choice between silicone gel and saline breast implants. A variety of implant shapes are available, depending on your preference. <strong>Dr</strong><strong>Tawfik</strong><strong>Sefrioui </strong>will discuss with you the choice of implant and what size changes are possible for your body structure. There are a number of areas where your cosmetic surgeon can make an incision to insert the breast implants:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li>In the crease underneath your breast</li>
                            <li>Along the lower edge of your areola</li>
                            <li>In your axilla or armpit</li>
                            </ol>
                          </div>
                         <div>
                           <p>Natural breast augmentation with your body&rsquo;s <strong>own fat may be a good option for breast enlargement in patients reluctant to use breast implants and who desire a natural look with their own tissue </strong>. Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui is one of a handful of early pioneers in this new technology that uses the patient&rsquo;s own fat Using the WAL TECHNOLOGY to Harvest the best quality viable fat animated with stem cells to create a natural filler for breast enhancement.</p>
                            <p>Many patients desiring simple breast augmentation also have anatomic differences in their chest wall or very thin tissues where the implant is likely to show through the skin. In the past, there was little a patient or surgeon could do to address these concerns. Now, with the use of fat grafting, we can shape deficiencies in the breast, address asymmetries, chest wall abnormalities and thin tissues at the same time as the breast augmentation.</p>
                            <p>What to Expect During Recovery from Natural Breast Augmentation? A surgical dressing will protect your incisions. You will experience some swelling and bruising for several days after the breast augmentation surgery. When only fat is used, recovery is very quick and otherwise some mild bruising there is very little pain. The surgeon will also prescribe pain medication to ease any discomfort. After healing, your new breasts will appear natural and enhanced.</p>

                            <p>A breast lift, also known as a mastopexy, is a procedure that surgically corrects sagging and drooping of the breasts. A youthful breast position is high on the chest with nipples that align approximately horizontal to the midline of the upper arms. The breast lift eliminates excess skin and tissues and allows your Changes surgeon to shift the breast position upward. Ultimately, the procedure allows a woman to revitalize the breasts, restoring their firmness and giving them a more youthful appearance.</p>

                            <p>A breast lift typically involves an incision around the nipple extending downward to the breast fold and under. Some women are uncomfortable with the idea of a visible breast scar and are dissuaded from undergoing a breast lift because of it.</p>
                            <p><strong><h6>WHY CHOOSE SCARLESS BREAST LIFT?</h6></strong></p>
                            <p>Now we offer a Scarless Breast Lift Procedure that ensures a woman can reshape and lift the breasts and leave the treated area scarless. Our Scarless Breast Lift treatment leverages the newest technology to guarantee a woman can rejuvenate the breasts <em>without </em>having to go under the knife.</p>
                            <p>There are many reasons why a woman may consider a traditional breast lift, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Proven Results: A breast lift is the only option for restoring breasts to a youthful and proportional position.</li>
                            <li>Increased Self-Confidence: Various studies have indicated that a breast lift procedure may help women boost their self-esteem through an improved body image.</li>
                            <li>Improved Breast Symmetry: Asymmetrical breasts can be corrected during a breast lift.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A Scarless Breast Lift offers the same benefits as a standard breast lift procedure, but eliminates the need for incisions on the breast. The incisionless breast lift requires no scalpels so there are no scars,</p>
                            <p>The Scarless Breast Lift is performed under local anesthetic and patients can go home after the procedure. Patients are instructed to support their breasts for the following 4-6 weeks in a lifted position using athletic tape in order to maximize the effectiveness of the tissue shrinkage. Scarless Breast Lift patients can resume normal activities immediately and resume exercise in approximately one week.</p>

                            <p><strong><h6>WHO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SCARLESS BREAST LIFT?</h6></strong></p>
                            <p>An incisionless Breast Lift procedure represents a great treatment option for women who want to restore breast shape after pregnancy and breastfeeding. With an Scarless Breast Lift, a woman can repair stretching and sagging of the breasts that may occur after pregnancy. A Scarless Breast Lift may also serve as an ideal option for a woman who through the natural aging process has seen her breasts fall and would like a more lifted, perky breast silhouette. For women who have always had asymmetrical breasts, a Scarless Breast Lift may be appropriate for lifting the position of one breast to match the other. During your consultation, Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui will review your desired improvements and determine if a Scarless Breast Lift is the best treatment option for you.</p>

                          <p>Breast reduction alleviates the physical symptoms caused by excessively heavy breasts, and may improve the shape and symmetry of the breasts. Following breast reduction, your breasts will be more proportional to the rest of your body, and clothes will fit you better.</p>
                          <p>During a private consultation, you will be asked about your desired breast size, as well as anything else about your breasts that you would like to see improved. This will help <strong>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui will </strong>understand your expectations, and determine whether they realistically can be achieved.</p>

                     				<p>Since my first OBGYN residency training, I have been involved in the fight to constantly improve the surgical care we give to woman with breast cancer. I believe this started when I was in the Oncology surgery training, in Tunisia and later in Gustave Roussy Hospital in Paris throughout my fellowship in Breast cancer and Reconstruction. Back then woman had the option of mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation therapy; few woman were choosing breast reconstruction, and hardly never at the time of the mastectomy.</p>
                            <p>As I learned to perform mastectomies I saw the importance of removing all the breast tissue necessary to beat the cancer, but was appalled at the deforming results of the surgery. In the early '90s most reconstruction was performed with tissue expanders as a first stage and then later replaced with breast implants. Throughout the remaining years of the 20th century, tissue flaps such as TRAM flaps, DIEP, SIEA, S-GAP and I-GAP and Latissimus muscle flaps gained popularity and improved the quality of breast reconstruction.</p>
                            <p>However, it was the advent of the skin sparing mastectomy at the beginning of the millennium, and later the nipple sparing mastectomy, that completely turned things around. Never before had we achieved such excellent results in breast reconstruction as we did after these advances in mastectomies. With this new era in treatment of breast cancer, we were able to perform reconstructions with implants that began to achieve aesthetic results almost as good as our cosmetic procedures. The addition of autologous fat grafting, or liposuction from the patient injected to the reconstructed breast finally lead to achieving aesthetic results on per with cosmetic breast augmentation in many patients. I am looking forward to a future where we will employ the use of biologically absorbable scaffolds combined with fat grafting that will do away with the need for silicone implants and reconstruct a totally natural looking, and feeling, breast.</p>
