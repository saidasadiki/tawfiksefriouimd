                          PRP, or platelet rich plasma, is a substance derived from your own
                          blood that contains high levels of platelets, the cells in our blood
                          that assist in blood clotting, contain growth factors, and assist in
                          cell regeneration. PRP has been used for many years in orthopedic
                          medicine and dentistry due to its ability to accelerate healing. More
                          recently, PRP has become popular in aesthetic medicine due to its
                          ability to stimulate collagen development and cell regeneration. PRP
                          can help with a wide array of cosmetic concerns including improvement
                          in skin texture, scarring, thickness, and hair loss.

                            <div>Prior to treatment, a blood sample will be taken from you. The blood is then placed into a centrifuge which spins the blood and separates the PRP from the rest of the blood. The PRP can then be applied to the skin topically in conjunction with microneedling or laser, or injected into the skin where the platelets create a mesh that stimulates wound healing and collagen production over time.</div>
                            <div>PRP is almost always combined with other treatments such as microneedling, laser, fillers, and fat transfer to provide significant improvements in skin texture and thickness, scarring, restoration of facial volume and hair loss. Please schedule a consultation today to find out if PRP therapy is right for you.</div>
                            <div>Recovery time depends on the type of PRP treatment that was performed. The downtime for topical PRP and microneedling is usually 1-3 days, topical PRP and laser is usually 3-7 days. Patients receiving injectable PRP treatments may experience mild bruising and swelling with downtime between 3-5 days. Results are visible after several weeks.</div>
                            <div>For skin rejuvenation, optimal results are seen after 2-3 treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart, followed by an annual treatment for maintenance thereafter. Patients with more extensive collagen loss will typically need a series of 3-4 treatments every 3-4 weeks, followed by maintenance treatments twice a year. For hair loss, 3-6 treatments spaced 4 weeks are needed. More difficult cases may need additional treatments.

                          Microneedling, also called collagen induction therapy, is a method of
                          skin rejuvenation using a motorized device with multiple fine needles
                          to create uniform punctures in the skin surface. The tiny punctures
                          created by the needles extend down 0.5–3 mm into the skin and stimulate
                          the body to produce new collagen and elastin over time. The result is
                          an improvement in skin texture and firmness, reduction in pore size,
                          and softening of acne scars and stretch marks.

                             Your face will be cleansed to remove any makeup and impurities. An anesthetic cream will be applied to the entire treatment area for 30-45 minutes to make the procedure more comfortable. After removal of the anesthetic cream, a gel containing skin-stimulating peptides will be applied to the treatment area. The microneedling device is then moved across the skin surface in multiple directions for 10-15 minutes, creating thousands of microscopic channels into the skin and allowing for deeper penetration of the peptide gel. Slight bleeding may occur, but this is normal and desirable as it indicates stimulation of blood vessels that will induce new collagen formation. Following the procedure, a soothing serum will be applied to moisturize and protect the skin.

                             Your face will be red following your microneedling treatment, similar to a sunburn. Slight bruising or swelling may occur but is less common. For most people, these symptoms will resolve within 48-72 hours. Mineral-based makeup and sunscreen SPF 30+ can be applied the day after microneedling, but products containing retinol or acids (glycolic, salicylic, etc) should be avoided for at least 3 days post-treatment.
                           </div> 
                           <div>
                            Since the results from microneedling are cumulative, multiple treatments are strongly encouraged to achieve the best outcome. For skin rejuvenation, an initial series of four treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart is recommended, followed by a treatment every 3 months for maintenance. For more difficult conditions to treat such as acne scarring or stretch marks, multiple series of treatments may be required.

                     Often, patients find that one or two treatments are sufficient. However,

               <br/>
               A VISIA imaging session uses multi-spectral imaging and analysis to capture
               key visual information for six areas affecting complexion health and
               appearance: wrinkles, spots, pores, evenness (color variation in the skin
               tone), porphyrins (evidence of bacteria in pores), and UV spots
               (characteristic of photodamage, typically from overexposure to sun).
               Additionally, VISIA provides an informative comparison of your complexion’s
               characteristics to those of other women of your same age and ethnicity.
               This comprehensive information enables your skin care professional to

               The use of adipose tissue, which is rich in stem and regenerative cells has
               undergone a renaissance in the reconstructive and aesthetic surgery.
               Enriched fat injections is a procedure whereby a patient’s fat tissue is
               enriched with his or her own regenerative cells to create a natural filler.
               The applications are widespread with potential benefits in breast
               augmentation, facial cosmetics, breast reconstruction and contour
               deformities from a variety of acquired and congenital disorders.</div>

                 Radiesse® (Radiance) is a pure, synthetic compound with a record of safety
                 that extends more than 25 years. It is comprised of microspheres of calcium
                 hydroxylapatite, combined with an aqueous gel. The key element of Radiesse®
                 is identical to the chemical structure of calcium naturally present in the
                 human body. Throughout its life, Radiesse® remains soft and flexible and
                 also exceptionally compatible with the body.
                 <br/>
                 Unlike temporary treatments that must be repeated, Radiesse® may provide
                 years of rejuvenation. However, the resorption rate is variable and we have
                 had some patients in whom the material was gone by 6 months. It is
                 gradually replaced by the body’s own tissue, and slowly dissolves away in
                 some cases up to seven years later. Radiesse® is FDA-approved for soft
                 tissue marking in any anatomical location, vocal cord injection and oral
                 and maxillofacial augmentation. FDA approval for facial implant is pending.
                 Internationally, Radiesse has received approval for facial implant and

                  As we age, our skin changes. Over time, the natural volume of youthful skin
                  begins to diminish as wrinkles and folds form. But, with Juvederm®
                  injectable gel, you don’t have to just sit back and let it happen! Approved
                  by the FDA, Juvederm® injectable gel is a “next-generation” dermal filler.
                  The smooth consistency gel helps to instantly restore your skin’s volume
                  and smooth away facial wrinkles and folds, like your “smile lines” or
                  “parentheses” (nasolabial folds – the creases that run from the bottom of
                  your nose to the corners of your mouth).
                  <br/>
                  Juvederm® is a smooth consistency gel made of hyaluronic acid – a naturally
                  occurring substance in your skin that helps to add volume and hydration.
                  Your healthcare professional eases Juvederm® injectable gel under the skin
                  to provide a smooth, natural look and feel – so everyone will notice (but
                  no one will know)! In fact, studies show superior results of Juvederm®
                  compared to a popular collagen-based dermal filler. And, almost 90% of all
                  study volunteers who were treated with both Juvederm® injectable gel and
                  another popular dermal filler preferred Juvederm®! In addition, Juvederm®
                  injectable gel is the first FDA-approved hyaluronic acid dermal filler that
                  is proven to be safe and effective for persons of color.</div> 
                  <div>
                   Restylane® is a crystal-clear, non-animal, biodegradable gel based on a
                   natural substance, called hyaluronic acid. The gel is injected into the
                   skin in tiny amounts with a very fine needle. The result is instantaneous
                   and produces a long-lasting, natural enhancement that is gentle and safe to
                   your skin.
                   <br/>
                   Restylane will last from 6 to 12 months and is very effective for
                   diminishing wrinkles around the corners of the mouth, the lips, the
                   nasolabial folds and the frown lines. Restylane is also an excellent
                   temporary filler for lip augmentation. Experience shows that it is
                   effective for up to six months when injected in the lips. Restylane is a
                   long-lasting, but not permanent, result, leaving you the option of
                   adjusting your treatment in tune with changing taste and fashion.</div>

                     BOTOX® Cosmetic injections are one of the most frequent procedures we
                     perform our department of Skin and Laser Center. Botox Cosmetic injections
                     are a highly diluted derivative of Botulinum Toxin Type A, which relaxes
                     the muscles that cause wrinkling by blocking the release of acetylcholine,
                     the chemical that causes muscles to contract. Although F.D.A. approved in
                     2002, cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists have been using Botox Cosmetic to
                     treat facial wrinkles such as crow’s feet and frown lines for 10 years.
                     <br/>
                     Botox Cosmetic injections are a great way to reduce your facial wrinkles.
                     With continued use of Botox Cosmetic your wrinkles may actually lessen and
                     may disappear for prolonged periods of time. Most people come in 2-3 times
                     per year for Botox Cosmetic injections.</div>

                      Many wrinkle fillers are on the market today and more are being introduced
                      at a very rapid rate. It is getting difficult to tell one filler from
                      another. Often, it is like the “flavor of the week” from a patient’s
                      perspective. Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui is a recognized authority on fillers and
                      lectures internationally on the principles and uses of wrinkle fillers.
                      <br/>
                      We are here to help you decipher the differences in fillers and to make an
                      intelligent decision for your own particular concerns. Basically, there are
                      3 types of fillers available today. There are temporary, longer-lasting,
                      and permanent fillers that are made from a wide range of substances. The
                      most widely used temporary fillers are Juvederm and Restylane. Radience (or
                      Radiesse) and Sculptra are longer-lasting in many cases, but not permanent.
                      They tend to last from 6-9 months up to 2 years.
