                                                   constant. Limping or favoring one leg to the other to reduce the pain of
                                                   walking occurs, however this can lead to additional problems in the hips
                                                   and leg joints. It is at this point that we recommend patients start
                                                   tracking the pain levels in a log or diary, and look for triggers that
                                                   cause episodes of pain. This allows a doctor to better understand how to
                                                   address and to improve your condition and injury.

                                                   we walk and that contortion leads to hip strain and aggravation. With our

                                                   : using a patient’s own blood, we take platlets, concentrate, condense and
                                                   then process them, using growth factors from inside the platlets, which we
                                                   then re-inject into the patient’s damaged tissue to stimulate tissue

                                                   Severe headaches, such as migraines, can be caused by several stimulants:
                                                   bright lights, strong smells, exhaustion blunt force trauma to the head, or
                                                   neck injuries. The pain can also stem from surrounding tissues and nerves,
                                                   muscles, ligaments and joints.

                                                   Treatment for neuropathy has traditionally included physical therapy and

                                                   may want to consider regenerative medicine, such as stem cell therapy. Stem
                                                   cells bring an entirely new approach to chronic pain treatment, and in
                                                   treating damaged nerves affected by neuropathy. Stem cells are unique in
                                                   that they have the incredible ability to replicate and create new, healthy
                                                   cells, while repairing damaged tissue. The best stem cells to use for
                                                   neuropathy are embryonic, bone marrow or fat-derived.

                                                   from the patient’s own body, and can provide lasting relief. First, the
                                                   doctor will remove a bit of fat from your body – usually your leg or
                                                   stomach. Next, the cells are processed using a centrifuge and incubator to
                                                   isolate the adult stem cells from the fat cells. The isolated stem cells
                                                   are then reinjected into the areas of the involved nerves and damaged
                                                   tissues. Patients can expect relief in a few weeks to months following
                                                   treatment.

                                                   life. Traditionally anti-inflammatory medicine, like NSAIDs (ibuprofen,
                                                   aspirin, naproxen sodium) have been prescribed and widely – and frequently
                                                   – taken. However, painkillers provide only temporary relief and daily use
                                                   can have side effects. Medicine also doesn’t address the root cause of your
                                                   neck pain. In contrast, Regenerative Medicine has shown surprising success
                                                   in treating and relieving the cause of neck pain.

                                                   Most people who experience neck pain are suffering from pain due to muscle
                                                   strains, worn joints, nerve compression, injuries – such as car or sports
                                                   injuries, or diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

                                                   our goal is to look at the whole person to determine where the
                                                   misalignments are occurring. We have seen great success using the following
                                                   regenerative medical treatments to relieve neck pain:
                                                   <br/>
                                                   <strong>PRP (Platlet Rich Plasma) Therapy</strong>
                                                   : using a patient’s own blood, we take platlets, concentrate, condense and
                                                   then process them, using growth factors from inside the platlets, which we
                                                   then re-inject into the patient’s damaged tissue to stimulate tissue
                                                   healing.
                                                   <br/>
                                                   <strong>Platelet Lysate (PL) –</strong>
                                                   A stem cell therapy, which is PRP’s more advanced cousin in a way. It’s
                                                   very anti-inflammatory, so it can be used around nerves, and can offer
                                                   relief for neck pain, lower back pain or buttock and leg pain.

                                                   Once injected, stem cells begin their job or restoring and rebuilding the
                                                   diseased tissue or disc in the neck. Typically, patients will see results
                                                   in about 3 weeks, and the inflammation starts to reduce and continues to do
                                                   so for several months.

                                                   we know that spinal discomfort and pain can have a dramatic impact on
                                                   simple tasks, causing them to become excruciating. Spinal pain is often the
                                                   result of sports injuries, taxing the back muscles beyond their ability,
                                                   improper posture or standing or from something as simple as trying to
                                                   catch your balance when tripping or falling. We understand that spinal pain
                                                   can take the joy out of life, so let us help restore your mobility.

                                                   low back pain. Steroids are injected into the epidural space around the
                                                   spinal nerves. The anti-inflammatory effect of the corticosteroid can
                                                   relieve pain when that pain is caused by inflammation of the roots of the
                                                   nerves branching out from the spine.

                                                   the neck, mid back and low back. A small amount of steroids are injected
                                                   into the area to ease pain and inflammation. Relief can last for months or

                                                   arthritic changes. A medial branch block is an injection of a strong local
                                                   anesthetic on the medial branch nerves that supply the facet joints. If you

                                                   sympathetic nerve bundle in the lumbar spine. This is used to treat a
