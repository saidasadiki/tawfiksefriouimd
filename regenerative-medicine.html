                                                          <p>The use of fat (adipose) tissue presents a new option in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery.</p>
                      <p>Fat is good! It turns out that fat removed through Liposuction procedures can be valuable for the regeneration of soft tissue defects, scar management, healing of wounds for diabetic ulcers, post radiation burns and chronic ulcers in patients.</p>
                      <p><strong><h6>The Q-Graft: the Revolutionary device to harvest SVF cell harvesting at the point-of-care:</h6></strong></p>
                      <p>The new compact Q-graft&reg; system for the intraoperative separation and collection of adipose regenerative cells &ndash; stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and adipose stem cells (ASC) &ndash; will enhance and facilitate the research and clinical applications of adipose derived regenerative cells in many therapeutic indications.</p>
                      <p>The Q-graft&reg; system consists of</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>the single-use<strong> Q-graft&reg; collector</strong> and</li>
                      <li>the device <strong>Q-graft&reg; control</strong>.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>The Q-graft&reg; collector allows to collect and concentrate the lipoaspirate and to separate the regenerative cells (SVF and ASC/adMSC) in one sterile closed system, directly on the sterile instrument table in the operating room or in the research laboratory.</p>
                      <p>The corresponding control unit Q-graft&reg; control regulates the functions of the single-use Q-graft&reg; collector. The Q-graft&reg; collector is placed on top of Q-graft&reg; control, directly on the sterile operating or instrument table. Q-graft&reg; control regulates the warming and mixing of the lipoaspirate during incubation, and the cross flow filtration during the concentration of the SVF cell suspension.</p>
                      <p>The lipid free SVF cell suspension is directly sampled from the sterile Q-graft&reg; collector into a syringe via the CELLS port.</p>
                      <p><strong><h6>The advantages of the Q-Graft system</h6> </strong></p>
                      <p><strong>1- SAFE</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Standardized, sterile fat harvesting: SVF cell separation in a standardized process &ndash; in a closed system &ndash; on the sterile OR instrument table.</li>
                      <li>The special enzyme Humanase&reg; (GMP grade) provides the exact dosage of collagenase for one separation process.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong> 2- EFFECTIVE</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Highly efficient separation, concentration and collection of high</li>
                      <li>numbers of viable, lipid-free regenerative cells</li>
                      <li>(SVF, ASC, MSC). right on the sterile operating/instrument table</li>
                      <li>Sterile sampling of regenerative cells: The lipid free SVF cell suspension is directly sampled from the CELLS port of Q-graft&reg; collector into a syringe via Luer connector.</li>
                      <li>Time and cost saving: optimum tissue dissociation. Heating of the lipoaspirate to 38 degrees Celsius and effective mixing in the Q-graft&reg; collector.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong> 3- EASY</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>No laboratory and no centrifugation required. No</li>
                      <li>transfer of tissue or cells outside the operating</li>
                      <li>room, e.g. to a laboratory and back</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong><h6>The gentle power of the water-jet</h6></strong></p>
                      <p>The innovative principle of the water-jet assisted method is based on using the gentle power of the water-jet in an intelligent manner.</p>
                      <p><strong><h6>The innovations of water-jet technology</h6></strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>The low mechanical force effect during liposuction, due to a moderate suction and the selective power of the water-jet, allows for a much easier handling of the cannula. In turn making it more comfortable for both the surgeon and the patient.</li>
                      <li>The precise and tissue-sparing detachment of fat cells from the tissue structure minimizes the patient&rsquo;s pain, swelling, reduces the risk of a hematoma and shortens the convalescent period.</li>
                      <li>The simultaneous irrigation and aspiration, coupled with the smaller volume of tumescent fluid used (approx. 70% less tumescent fluid used for pre infiltration) reduces the stress on the tissue.</li>
                      <li>The use of a centrifuge, or other fat processing procedures, are not necessary which results in time-saving and a better vitality of the fat cells.</li>
                      <li>The smooth and passive mixture of the fat collected in the container improves the consistency of the fat removed from different body areas (e.g. from abdomen and thighs).</li>
                      <li>Easy and direct extraction of the untreated fat cells from the container</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Our cannulas enhance the innovative use of the water-jet. They represent one component of the sterile and closed liposuction and fat harvesting system designed in our research and development department.</p>
                      <p>Our cannulas allow gentle detaching of the fat cells from the tissue whilst simultaneously aspirating them. This saves time and protects the aspirated fat cells. Furthermore, the pressure of the fine, fan-shaped water-jet can be adjusted to the different connective tissue structures. As a result, the surrounding subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as nerves and blood vessels, remain much less traumatised.</p>
                      <p>Besides the advantage of a particularly sparing and almost pain-free liposuction, much more vital adipose tissue can be harvested using the water jet-assisted method. The higher the quality and the more vital the harvested adipose tissue is, the greater are the chances that the injected fat cells adhere after autologous fat transfer.</p>
                      <p>Likewise, we significantly improved the collection and processing of the body&rsquo;s own fat for autologous fat transfer. The harvested fat is gently separated from the remaining fluid in our LipoCollector&reg; or FillerCollector&reg; and can be immediately used for fat transfer.</p>
                      <p><strong><h6>Cell Treatments at the scarless cosmetic surgery:</h6></strong></p>
                      <p>We offer autologous fat grafting with stem cells for regeneration of soft tissue defects, scar management, healing of wounds for diabetic ulcers, post radiation burns and chronic ulcers for patients. We also offer all forms of aesthetic surgery such as breast augmentation using fat grafting, implant removal and replacement with fat (for capsular fibrosis), breast reconstruction using fat (after mastectomy for breast cancer), gluteal and hip augmentation (Colombian Butt lift) and facial fillers including nasolabial fold, lips and asymmetries. Other procedures involving the patients own fat include rejuvenation of hands and replacing facial volume during a face lift procedure.</p>
                      <p>One major advantage of fat grafting is that it is safe and simple, often not even involving a cut in the skin, thus minimising scaring and enabling the patient to return to their daily activities within a few hours to days.</p>

                                                   using a patient’s own blood, we take platlets, concentrate, condense and

                                                   Typically, you first notice knee pain when that pain becomes a daily
                                                   constant. Limping or favoring one leg to the other to reduce the pain of
                                                   walking occurs, however this can lead to additional problems in the hips
                                                   and leg joints. It is at this point that we recommend patients start
                                                   tracking the pain levels in a log or diary, and look for triggers that
                                                   cause episodes of pain. This allows a doctor to better understand how to
                                                   address and to improve your condition and injury.

                                                   Back problems can also lead to hip pain and problems, because typically if

                                                   Treatment for neuropathy has traditionally included physical therapy and
                                                   primarily treating the root cause of the disease, for example treating

                                                   If traditional neuropathy treatments have not proven successful, then you
                                                   may want to consider regenerative medicine, such as stem cell therapy. Stem
                                                   cells bring an entirely new approach to chronic pain treatment, and in
                                                   treating damaged nerves affected by neuropathy. Stem cells are unique in
                                                   that they have the incredible ability to replicate and create new, healthy
                                                   cells, while repairing damaged tissue. The best stem cells to use for
                                                   neuropathy are embryonic, bone marrow or fat-derived.

                                                   The stem cell therapy procedure is relatively painless, using stem cells
                                                   from the patient’s own body, and can provide lasting relief. First, the
                                                   doctor will remove a bit of fat from your body – usually your leg or
                                                   stomach. Next, the cells are processed using a centrifuge and incubator to
                                                   isolate the adult stem cells from the fat cells. The isolated stem cells
                                                   are then reinjected into the areas of the involved nerves and damaged
                                                   tissues. Patients can expect relief in a few weeks to months following
                                                   treatment.

                                                   Do you suffer from chronic neck pain? It can be debilitating and hard to
                                                   manage the pain while staying productive and active in your day to day
                                                   life. Traditionally anti-inflammatory medicine, like NSAIDs (ibuprofen,
                                                   aspirin, naproxen sodium) have been prescribed and widely – and frequently
                                                   – taken. However, painkillers provide only temporary relief and daily use
                                                   can have side effects. Medicine also doesn’t address the root cause of your
                                                   neck pain. In contrast, Regenerative Medicine has shown surprising success

                                                   <strong>PRP (Platlet Rich Plasma) Therapy</strong>
                                                   : using a patient’s own blood, we take platlets, concentrate, condense and
                                                   then process them, using growth factors from inside the platlets, which we
                                                   then re-inject into the patient’s damaged tissue to stimulate tissue

                                                   very anti-inflammatory, so it can be used around nerves, and can offer
                                                   relief for neck pain, lower back pain or buttock and leg pain.

                                                   Once injected, stem cells begin their job or restoring and rebuilding the
                                                   diseased tissue or disc in the neck. Typically, patients will see results
                                                   in about 3 weeks, and the inflammation starts to reduce and continues to do
                                                   so for several months.

                                                   improper posture or standing or from something as simple as trying to
                                                   catch your balance when tripping or falling. We understand that spinal pain
                                                   can take the joy out of life, so let us help restore your mobility.

                                                   Epidural Steroid Injection is a technique for relieving neck, mid-back and
                                                   low back pain. Steroids are injected into the epidural space around the
                                                   spinal nerves. The anti-inflammatory effect of the corticosteroid can
                                                   relieve pain when that pain is caused by inflammation of the roots of the
                                                   nerves branching out from the spine.

                                                   Regenerative and stem cell treatments are invaluable in helping with

                                                   A facet joint injection is done to relieve pain from the small joints in
                                                   the neck, mid back and low back. A small amount of steroids are injected
                                                   into the area to ease pain and inflammation. Relief can last for months or
                                                   years.

                                                   Facet joints can become inflamed and cause pain with certain injuries or
                                                   arthritic changes. A medial branch block is an injection of a strong local
                                                   anesthetic on the medial branch nerves that supply the facet joints. If you
                                                   get significant relief from this procedure for a short period of time, then
                                                   we would follow with a Radiofrequency nerve ablation to obtain lasting pain
                                                   relief.

                                                   Platlet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a product rich in proteins. We draw blood from
                                                   the patient, then spin it down to get rid of blood cells, and to have a
                                                   protein rich product. This can be used with our without stem cells for a

                                                   A Spinal Cord Stimulator is a device that stimulates the spinal cord with
                                                   electrical impulses sent by an electrical wire that is implanted in the
                                                   spine. In a trial, we determine whether the stimulator will help the pain
                                                   prior to recommending a permanent stimulator.

                                                   A Stellate Ganglion Block is an injection of a long-acting anesthetic to
                                                   the stellate ganglion nerve bundle in the neck. This is a sympathetic nerve
                                                   bundle that when injected can “reset” that system and help with regional
                                                   pain syndrome that occurs in the arms.

                                                   sympathetic nerve bundle in the lumbar spine. This is used to treat a

                                                   relieve chronic pain from the sacroiliac joint. The SI joint is a large
