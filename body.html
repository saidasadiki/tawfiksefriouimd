                              <em>Liposuction is suitable to reshape nearly any area of the body: the face, the neck, the upper arms, the back, the breasts, the tummy and, of course, also the legs and the bottom.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>MY NEW LOOK: A MORE AESTHETIC AND MORE ATTRACTIVE BODY SHAPE.<br>
                              No matter what area of the body is subjected to the procedure, the contours immediately become noticeably slimmer and more harmonious. The classic example is what is referred to as &ldquo;saddlebags&rdquo;, which are isolated fat pads on the outer sides of the thighs, particularly affecting women. In this case, neither exercising or dieting can help. The only successful therapy is liposuction. After the procedure, the legs look slim and you can again wear clothing that highlights these body parts instead of concealing them.
                            </p>
                            <p>As far as the face is concerned, chubby cheeks and double chins can be removed, giving the face a more striking overall appearance. Liposuction is also suitable to reduce and reshape the tummy, hips, bottom, breast, arms and back.</p>
                            <p>We perform the latest technology of Liposuction under local Anaesthesia in different area of the face and body associated with skin tightening to avoid doing tummy-tuck.</p>
                            <p>In case of Diathesis a scarless reflection of the Fascia is performed with a specific technique.</p>

                                  <p>Hydro dissection is the key principle of the facelift concept, called the Aqualift.</p>
                                  <p>The waterjet technology offers minimal impact and collateral damage with powerful dissection. Using the mobilization force of the waterjet, for example the mandibular ligaments, that have to be dissected for a natural reposition of the facial structures, can be addressed with minimal risk of nerve irritation or damage and significantly less bleeding in comparison to the conventional technique with transilluminating. Besides the advantages due to the tissue selective characteristics, the dissection takes place in considerably faster reducing the time, the procedure requires overall.</p>
                                  <p>Another advantage for both the patient and the surgeon is, that the procedure does not require drainage of the operation site by drainages and can be performed as an outpatient procedure.</p>
                                  <p>Compliance and follow up are easier, when the patients don&rsquo;t suffer from severe bruising and swelling. Even for smokers there is minimized danger of healing complications with less trauma due to the gentle waterjet dissection.</p>
                                  <p>Modern cosmetology annually provides new, increasingly unique and safe methods for preserving youth and beauty. A lot of high-tech devices were created to conduct procedures that help people to remain attractive and self-confident.</p>

                                  <h6>WHAT IS VASER 4D HI-DEF LIPOSUCTION?</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>VASER 4D Hi-Def Liposuction is one of the newest variations of surgical fat removal treatment that offers more precise and controlled results and a much faster recovery time. VASER is a technological device that liquefies fat prior to extraction in order to ensure a smooth and gentle removal process. This greatly improves recovery times and reduces potential risks compared to traditional liposuction; which requires the relatively forceful removal of fat using a cannula that can also additional bruising and swelling in the treatment area. Aside from a more rapid recovery, the smoother extraction of fat improves results, leaving more even and effective results.</p>
                                  <p>VASER 4D Hi-Def Liposuction is not the ideal surgery for losing a lot of weight or undergoing drastic body transformations&hellip; It&rsquo;s perfect for individuals that are close to their ideal weight with little body fat. VASER 4D Hi-Def Liposuction is particularly popular for use on the abdomen, but it can also be used on the hips and flanks, arms, and back. In certain cases male patients also enjoy effective results on their chest area (Gynecomastia).</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>
                                  <h6>HOW DOES VASER 4D HI-DEF LIPO WORK?</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>Dr. Sefrioui, through a series of small and inconspicuously placed incisions, will introduce a dilute anesthetic solution, as local anesthesia, into the area(s) being treated. Then the VASER 4D Hi-Def Liposuction cannula is presented through the same small discreet openings to melt and liquefy the unwanted fat. Lastly, small tubes, or &ldquo;cannulas&rdquo;, are placed through these same slits to gently aspirate and remove the liquefied unwanted fat.</p>

                                  <p align="center"><strong>Comparison synopsis between what is world wild proposed for the mommy makeover and my innovative and scarless approach: associating Know-How and Cutting-Edge Technology.</strong></p>
                                  <p>Most women who seek a mommy makeover have experienced some degree of breast changes, which can include a decrease in size, increase in size, more sagging, or a change in nipple size. In addition, the abdominal wall may change, creating stretch marks, extra skin and relaxation and separation of the abdominal wall muscles. Also, some of us have stubborn fat deposits that weren&rsquo;t there prior to the hormonal changes that occur with pregnancy. In addition to these alterations, possible changes in the labia can develop from congestion during pregnancy.</p>
                                  <p>The important thing to recognize about the Mommy Makeover is that just as all our children our different, so are the effects that having children can have on our bodies! Thankfully, the Mommy Makeover is customizable enough to adapt for any of these issues. No matter how many fixes you need, it is possible to perform all procedures at the same time for your Mommy Makeover, or to separate them if necessary.</p>
                                  <strong>
                                    <h6>Breast :</h6>
                                  </strong>
                                  <p>Because of changes caused by pregnancy and breast feeding, women may wish to increase their breast volume through a breast augmentation with an implant. Although, women who had breast augmentation prior to pregnancy may find that their implants aren&rsquo;t quite right. They might require another breast augmentation to fix implants, and to either increase or decrease implant size. Others might find that the volume of the breast is fine, but the shape of the breast that has changed. These women might want a <strong>mastopexy</strong>, also known as a breast lift, to reshape the breast by tightening the breast tissue and the breast skin. A breast implant may be placed at the same time as the mastopexy if an increase in breast size is also desired.</p>

                                    <h6>Abdomen :</h6>
                                  </strong>
                                  <p>A tummy tuck is an essential part of the mommy makeover. During pregnancy, the belly&rsquo;s skin has to stretch to accommodate the growing baby while the abdominal wall muscles have to separate and stretch apart to allow for growth. Depending on your skin type, and how fast you gained your pregnancy weight you might also develop stretch marks. A tummy tuck, aka an abdominoplasty, can tighten muscle and skin while a mini tummy tuck can tighten only either skin or muscle. Unfortunately, while there is no magic cure for stretch marks yet, tightening the surrounding skin using a tummy tuck may help their appearance.</p>

                                    <h6>Liposuction :</h6>
                                  </strong>
                                  <p>Liposuction is one of the best procedures for body contouring and the Mommy Makeover. Liposuction is an important part of the mommy makeover because after pregnancy, many women find that they have gained new contours, unfortunately they&rsquo;re not the good kind! We more often see these changes in the posterior hips and sometimes the thighs. Thankfully, these areas are very responsive to the fat reduction techniques of liposuction. Liposuction is also great for areas like the hips, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, knees, upper arms, chin, cheeks, and neck.</p>
                                  <strong>
                                    <h6>Genital area :</h6>
                                  </strong>
                                  <p>During the later stages of pregnancy, it is not uncommon for the pelvis to become congested and to cause swelling of the labia. After pregnancy, some women find that the labia minora now hangs outside the labia majora, causing a lot of discomfort. A procedure to &ldquo;trim&rdquo; or shorten these labia can be done with any portion of your mommy makeover or be even alone, usually under local anesthesia.</p>
                                  <strong>
                                    <h6>Breast Enhancement Options</h6>
                                  </strong>
                                  <p>For those who have lost elasticity in their skin or desire higher, fuller breasts, a breast lift and/or breast augmentation may be appropriate using Fat Transfer to Restore your Breasts patients who opt for these procedures are usually extremely pleased with the results.</p>

                                  </strong>
                                  <p>Stretched-out skin in the abdominal region can be tightened up with a tummy tuck, and for the excess weight that you cannot seem to lose with diet and exercise, success can be achieved through liposuction. These procedures are all effective and affordable, and the team at Cosmetic Surgery Center will be with you every step of the way to provide the best care.</p>

                                  <h6>Exparel Injection</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>It is important to minimize pain after surgery so that you will be able to move around sooner and decrease problems created by lack of mobility, sleep and eat better, and feel better sooner. Most often pain is relieved by narcotics like morphine. These drugs act on the central nervous system and affect the entire body. Narcotics cause unwanted side effects of nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, drowsiness and alteration of mental status. Local anesthetics work by blocking and controlling pain in the area affected without narcotic side effects.</p>
                                  <p>Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui injects Exparel into the abdominal muscles. Exparel delivers a continuous safe long acting local anesthetic over about a 3 day period. Since most of the pain of a &ldquo;Tummy Tuck&rdquo; is due to the suture and repair of the abdominal muscles, Dr. Tawfik injects Exparel into the abdominal muscles that delivers a safe continuous amount of local long acting anesthetic. Because there is less pain from the abdomen you will need less oral pain medication, be able to move better and sooner, have a more comfortable recovery, and a faster return to normal activity.</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>
                                  <h6>Drains</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>After surgery, fluid ca builds up between tissue layers, causing a delay in the healing process. Drains are typically placed post-operatively as a means of preventing this fluid accumulation. By using TissuGlu in our tummy tucks, we can eliminate the needs for burdensome drains and the stress they can cause during recovery.</p>
                                  <p>TissuGlu gives our patients the advantage of no postoperative drain care, a better quality of life during recovery, and less burden on caregivers. We know that the pain and discomfort associated with drains is the number one complaint of abdominoplasty patients. Instead of spending time managing messy drains and anticipating the potentially painful drain removal procedure, you can get back to being you and start enjoying your results more quickly with TissuGlu.</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>
                                  <h6>What Will Be My Recovery After the Tummy Tuck?</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>Immediately after surgery you and your caregiver will be given detailed instructions about the care of the incisions, drains and catheters, medications, activity, ambulation and follow up. Most patients can return to work after about two weeks as long as this does not require excessive lifting, pushing or pulling activity.</p>
                                  <p>TissuGlu patients experience a better quality of life during recovery compared to drains. Our patients often feel so good after their tummy tucks that they want to do more than we recommend for post-operative activity, but remember you just had major surgery and you&rsquo;ll need time to heal. Be sure to carefully follow Dr. Sefrioui&rsquo;s recovery instructions.</p>

                                  <p>Lipedema (painful fat syndrome) is a chronic disease that occurs mostly in females. It is characterized by bilateral, symmetrical fatty tissue excess, mainly in the hip region, upper and lower leg areas and combined with a tendency for leg swelling that worsens with standing. In male patients lipedema is extremely rare (1). Lipedema is often misdiagnosed as bilateral lower extremity lymphedema or as simple obesity.</p>

                                  <h6>Ethology/Cause of Lipedema</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>The ethology of lipedema and other types of fatty tissue enlargement is still unknown though a genetic cause is suspected. Other possible causes of lipedema include metabolic, inflammatory, or hormonal involvement.</p>

                                  <h6>Differentiation between Lipedema / Lymphedema</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>To further explain lipedema, it is necessary to compare this condition to lymphedema. Lymphedema is usually asymmetrical and can be either acquired (through surgery, trauma or infection damaging the lymphatic system) or congenital (hereditary changes in the lymphatic system). The symmetrical enlargement of both lower limbs, from waist to ankles is a hallmark of lipedema. As the swelling continues and spreads from lower extremities to other parts of the body, the swelling is likely caused by slower lymphatic flow and changes in the lymphatic vessel structure caused by pressure in the lymphedematous limbs. This is known as Lipo-Lymphedema. Lipo-Lymphedema can also develop in combination with chronic venous insufficiency, and other vascular disorders.</p>
                                  <p>Lipedema can be under-diagnosed due the difficulty in differentiating it from other edemas. Some tools including tables and a flow chart that can be used to diagnose lipedema and other edemas can be found in the article "Edema: Diagnosis and Management."</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>
                                  <h6>Diagnosis</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>Currently, the best way to diagnose lipedema is performing manual inspection by a trained physician. Some clinicians may be familiar with the distinction between lipedema, lymphedema and obesity. Upon palpation of the fat the healthcare professional may feel tiny pebbles or pea like nodules. As the disease advances the nodules may increase in size and in number and may form strands of nodules. Communication between patients, clinicians and physicians should be encouraged.</p>
                                  <p>A definitive blood test for lipedema does not currently exist, therefore, some doctors recommend treating conditions that may exacerbate the lipedema symptoms. They may order tests to consider thyroid levels, markers of inflammation, vitamin D and B levels etc. At some stages of the disease it may be possible to see evidence of lipedema or lipo-lymphedema via ultrasound, MRI, lymphangiogram and/or lymphoscintigraphy. However, caution is needed due to test results that may appear &lsquo;normal&rsquo; when testing the early stages of lipedema. Such scans and diagnostic tools may inform the physician as to a treatment protocol.</p>
                                  <p>Schmeller distinguishes lipedema from lipohypertrophy (lipo-hypertrophy) which may present with a similar body shape but without pain and edema. He postulates that one condition may lead to the other and that people may move from one state to another. (4) More research needs to be done to determine if lipedema and lipohypertrophy are the same condition or are different from one another.</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>
                                  <h6>Treatment</h6></strong></p>
                                  <p>Even though lipedema was first formally identified in the U.S. at the Mayo Clinic in 1940 (5), most physicians are not readily familiar with the disorder. There is no cure yet identified for lipedema, however, early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the debilitation of the patient. Early weight and diet changes through nutrition and exercise may be helpful in reducing non-lipedemic fat and reducing inflammation. This approach may possibly prevent the lower body from enlarging as much as it would if the patient were to become obese. However, even with strict diet and exercise regimens the disease may progress and further treatments may be necessary.</p>
                                  <p>While there is no proven effective treatment for lipedema, the swelling may be somewhat managed with Compression garments, certain Products and Treatments, Manual Lymphatic Drainage and/or Complete Decongestive Therapy. Compression garments and other products can further help reduce the swelling and lessen the fluid return. Unfortunately, these garments may not be well tolerated by all patients if the patient experiences pain. It is important to work with a qualified provider to find the correct garments as the wrong garment can compress the initial lymphatic openings inhibiting lymph flow through the lymphatic vessels.</p>
                                  <p>Liposuction as a treatment for lipedema was developed in Germany in the late 1980s (6) and is becoming more common. While it has helped some patients when done by a skilled surgeon knowledgeable about lipedema, very few physicians have the knowledge and experience about how to treat these patients and technically skilled to perform this surgery on the legs and the arms, this technique needs years of experience to learn and to perform without complication . Given the fact that liposuction is a surgery and all surgeries come with risk, consulting one&rsquo;s primary care physician before surgery is recommended. Currently, different liposuction procedures used for lipedema patients are available but not all surgeries are suitable for all patients. Water Assisted Liposuction (WAL) is the procedure by excellence the routinely and successfully being performed in Few countries around the world and only handful surgeons are well trained to perform this procedure for lipedema patients. Patients are encouraged to consult with multiple physicians who perform liposuction procedures to gain insight into the physician&rsquo;s approach, outcomes and technique.</p>
                                  <p>Lipedema is sometimes accompanied by co-morbidities, often secondary diseases, which complicate the patient&rsquo;s health. Articular and venous diseases, lymphedema, obesity, and psycho-social disorders are often seen with lipedema patients. Medications for pain control, anxiety and depression are common prescriptions in this population. Some patients report reduction in symptoms with certain medicines and supplements. Gastric bypass or Bariatric surgery will not reduce the lipedemic fat, though it may help ease some of the co-morbidities that may be present.</p>

                            <p>Men and women alike share concerns about their midsection. From exercise resistant &ldquo;love handles&rdquo; and &ldquo;muffin tops&rdquo; to annoying belly rolls, people seek improvement of the stomach and abdomen. The aesthetic community has introduced many methods for scarless and nonsurgical improvement. now WE offer in our Facility a treatment that involves <strong>no scalpel, no scars, no incisions</strong>. The revolutionary Scareless Tummy Tuck in Casablanca is now available. Sometimes depending on the patient selection, this procedure might repeated few months down the road.</p>
                            <p>The Scareless Tummy Tuck is ideal for patients who have a small amount of excess skin and fat and are looking for a natural approach to skin tone, texture irregularities and tightening. Through the aging process, the bands or septate that hold the fat layer close to the skin become lax allowing the skin to fall away and become loose. The Subdermal skin tightening device during the scareless tummy tuck shrinks these bands allowing the skin to tighten while. In extreme cases of skin sagging or large amounts of fat, a surgical abdominoplasty may be recommended.</p>

                            <p>One of the most common problem areas for women are sagging, flabby upper arms. Loss of skin elasticity, excess fat and sagging skin of the upper arms have earned the less-than-affectionate nickname &ldquo;<strong>bat wings</strong>&rdquo;. This area is highly resistant to exercise. The only option for correction until this point has been a surgical procedure called a brachioplasty or arm lift. This procedure involves an incision along the inner upper arm that typically extends from the armpit to the elbow. The lengthy scar can be obvious and has actually been a deterrent for patients to move forward in upper arm reduction.</p>
                            <p>Now there is a <strong>scalpel-free and scarless </strong>option to correct bat wings. Scarless cosmetic surgery is Casablanca&rsquo;s single destination for correction of upper arm sagging without incisions. you can now benefit from upper arm reduction with surgery-like results and without a single incision.</p>
                            <p>Scarless Arm Lift results in circumferential skin tightening of the entire upper arm. Clinical studies show <strong>noticeable skin tightening immediately with continued contraction </strong>over the course of 6 months to a year after the initial procedure. The procedure is done in the under local anesthetic with quick recovery and under the safest conditions.</p>

                            <h6>Why do women get cellulite more than men?</h6></b></p>
                            <p>The structure of collagen, the main protein of connective tissue, in women has the appearance of a picket fence, whereas in men it looks more like a cross-linked fence. So you can see the cross-linked structure is much stronger and will hold fat in better.</p>
                            <p>Another reason women get cellulite has to do with the two kinds of androgenic receptors. When stimulated, alpha receptors will cause fat cells to produce fat as well as triggering constriction of blood vessels and release of sugar into the bloodstream when beta receptors are stimulated, they break down fat[as well as increasing heart rate and relaxing blood vessels. In women, for every one beta receptor in the thigh, there are nine alpha receptors.</p>
                            <p>v Estrogen also makes fat whereas testosterone breaks down fat. So a women&rsquo;s body is basically and I hate to say it&mdash;genetically designed to be a place for cellulite to develop. Men have one layer of fat throughout their entire body and a one-to-one alpha- and beta-receptor ratio.</p>

                            <h6>VASERsmooth procedure for Cellulite Removal: one treatment surgical results</h6></strong></p>
                            <p>In order to reduce cellulite, several things must be accomplished.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>First, the superficial fat must be reduced.</li>
                              <li>Second, some of the fibrous septate must be loosened to enable the skin to become flat and smooth,</li>
                              <li>Third, the skin must be tightened to smooth the skin's surface.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Until recently, it was difficult to accomplish this. Several totally non-invasive treatments showed modest and temporary results requiring innumerous treatments. As a world renowned expert in Tumescent, VASER and Laser Liposuction,<strong> Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui </strong>is enthusiastic and proud to offer the new VASERsmooth procedure, the latest addition to the Vaser Liposuction System which he has used for almost a decade. VASERsmooth permits us to treat cellulite with quick recoveries and obvious results.</p>
                            <p>The VASERsmooth procedure is performed totally under local anesthesia in our surgically accredited office. Prior to the procedure, if the patient desires, a sedative can be given to relax. Through a few tiny incisions that close without stitches or scars, local anesthesia is then infused under the skin to totally numb the region. Using the thin, ultrasonic 'VASERsmooth' wand designed specifically to be used just under the skin, the VASERsmooth device treats superficial fat, breaks the dimpling fibrous septae and tightens loose skin, resulting in an overall smoother appearance. After the treatment, a bandage is placed and the patient goes home in no discomfort. Most patients can shower the next day, return to work within 24 hours and exercise in a few days*. Dramatic results can be seen in as little as one week and progressively improve over 3-6 months*. VASERsmooth can be performed alone or with additional Tumescent Liposuction treatments for more extensive fat removal on any area of the body.

                                  <p>With lipofilling a certain amount of fat is first obtained with a refined liposuction technique from your abdomen, buttocks or knee. The fat is washed and purified and we even add here growth factors that we have subsequently purified from your blood using a PRP method here in our facility. This extra step ensures that you have a good survival of adipose tissue and the transplanted fat cells can find a good blood supply. Yet there always a certain percentage of the transplanted fat cells that do not survive lipofilling. <strong>Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui </strong>will have to over fill in order to achieve a perfect end result.</p>

This is the ultimate &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; procedure.
