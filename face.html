                                       As a person ages, frequently facial bones begin to recede and the facial
                                       tissues then lose their support. This, combined with loss of elasticity
                                       causes the skin to begin to sag and lift more loosely. Skin folds become
                                       more prominent around the chin, neck and jaw line. You may be interested in
                                       learning more about a face lift whenever these changes become a concern and
                                       your cosmetic surgeon recognizes opportunity for improvement.

                                    <p>
                                       A face lift can restore your sagging skin to its earlier position, tighten
                                       the face and neck and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It can bring back
                                       a more youthful appearance and boost self-esteem. The results of surgery
                                       can be dramatic for the older patient and subtler but very satisfying for
                                       the younger patient.

                                       You may also notice laxity of upper eyelid skin and formation of bags
                                       beneath the eyes. Eyelid surgery can be combined with a face lift if your
                                       eyelids are of concern to you. A brow lift can also be combined with a face
                                       lift if desired. We specialize in the rejuvenation of aging facial features
                                       through a combination of state-of-the-art treatments and techniques totally
                                       customized to the individual patient’s concerns and findings. Packages are
                                       available that have been scientifically designed to provide the best
                                       outcomes from surgery or laser treatments.

                                       face lift can reverse some of the natural changes in facial appearance that
                                       occur with time. The natural aging process, genetic influence, sun exposure
                                       and other factors cause the skin of the face to wrinkle and sag.
                                       Understanding how aging occurs makes it simpler to understand the options
                                       available to prevent and treat the signs of facial aging.

                                             <p><strong>Hydro dissection</strong> is the key principle of the facelift concept, called the <strong>Aqualift</strong>.</p>
                                             <p>Numerous are the advantages of this practice.</p>
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>The <strong>waterjet technology</strong> offers <strong>minimal</strong> impact and collateral damage with powerful dissection.</li>
                                                <li>It is advantageous for both the patient and the surgeon because the procedure does not require drainage of the operation site by drainages and can be performed as an outpatient procedure.</li>
                                                <li>Because the patients don&rsquo;t suffer from severe bruising and swelling, compliance and follow up are so much easier. Even for smokers there is minimized danger of healing complications with less trauma due to the gentle waterjet dissection.</li>

Each new technique is of great interest, therefore the name "Aqualifting" quickly appeared in the course of professionals of cosmetic surgeons and their patients.</p>
                                             <p><strong>So</strong> what is Aqualifting? How does it work? What are its effects? What are the Indications for use of a watery face lift and its Contraindications?</p>

                                             <h6>What is Aqualifting?</h6></b></p>
                                             <p>Aqualifting is a low-traumatic, absolutely effective and safe opportunity to make a facelift using small water jets. This method of restoring contours and getting rid of wrinkles was developed by Dr. Thomas Tork. <strong>His ideas were based on the fact that if a person consists of 70% of water, then the restoration of the full level of metabolic processes with the help of liquid will help to preserve the health and youth of.</strong></p>

                                             <h6>How does it work?</h6></b></p>
                                             <p><strong>The essence of the method is to use thin jets of water directly under the skin. This is achieved by means of a specially designed apparatus that delivers water head through specially supplied tubes directly into the skin of the face through microscopic punctures, the diameter of which should not be more than 3 mm </strong>.</p>
                                             <p>The finest liquid trickles wash different layers of the skin, including the ducts and lumens between the muscles. The vacuum that is drawn sucks out excess fatty deposits, toxins, plugs and clogs from under the skin of the face.</p>

                                             <h6>What are the effect of Aqualifting?</h6></b></p>
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>First<strong>, a noticeable reduction in the body fat</strong>. In fact, the facial contouring is carried out due to the release of lipids and the energetic direct micro massage of the internal tissues of. The angle of the lower jaw <strong>becomes more expressive</strong>, the skin on the cheeks <strong>becomes less flabby</strong>, it becomes even, <strong>its colour improves</strong>, and small and large wrinkled folds are <strong>smoothed out.</strong></li>
                                             </ul>
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>Second, <strong>a minimal traumatic effect on vessels</strong>, tissues and cells. With its help, the superfluous, obsolete small cells of the upper layer of the epithelium are eliminated. The <strong>regeneration period due to the high cleaning of tissues is greatly reduced</strong>, so the result of the procedure can be seen in less than a week.</li>
                                             </ul>
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>Third, <strong>a much faster recovery</strong>, by taking into account that the skin does not practically undergo surgical treatment, and the liquid remaining after the procedure is quickly absorbed by epidermal cells. Typical for cosmetologically interventions, <strong>negative side effects such as cuts, pain, swelling or bruising will be minimal .</strong></li>
                                             </ul>
                                             <p><strong>After the Aqualift, no standard proportion of such rehabilitation cases will be required, only rest is intensive moisturizing skin care.</strong></p>
                                             <p>Depending on the condition of the facial skin prior to the Aqualift, the effect can be carried out under both local and general Anesthesia. The decision about the type of Anesthesia is also affected by the patient's condition and his individual physiological parameters, which are discussed in advance with the surgeon.</p>
                                             <p>The procedure is quite subtle, so it is not suitable for people with deep sagging and wrinkles. They will need to enrol in standard types of facelifts, which are simple surgical procedures.</p>

                                                <li>This method of lifting is best suited to those who are concerned about the problem of sagging the cheeks, the appearance of "flaps" and the second chin, as well as those who are worried about the excess fatty deposits in the cervical collar zone.</li>
                                                <li>In addition to that, Aqualifting is also suitable for those who have a tarnishing of the skin, a noticeable deterioration in its appearance due to frequent inflammations, slowing healing processes. The complete washout of toxins, fat and dead cells that interfere with skin nutrition and metabolic processes, contribute to a general improvement in the health of the upper layer of the epidermis and the return of former attractiveness.</li>

                                                <li><strong>The doctor&rsquo;s consultation is primordial:</strong> It is important to remember that the procedure of Aqualifting, although it does not require special preparation, must be necessarily agreed with the doctor. The specialist will help to understand whether the chosen method is rational in a specific clinical case, and also depending on the characteristics of the patient will help choose between exposure to purified water or additionally a solution of electrolytes.</li>
                                                <li><strong>The cost of the procedure:</strong> Like any procedure that is a cosmetology intervention, Aqualifting is expensive enough for the price, therefore, in order to avoid additional waste and recovery, all the specialist's instructions must be followed before and after the braces with the help of micro water-jets.</li>

                                             <p>The waterjet technology offers minimal impact and collateral damage with powerful dissection. Using the mobilization force of the waterjet, for example the mandibular ligaments, that have to be dissected for a natural reposition of the facial structures, can be addressed with minimal risk of nerve irritation or damage and significantly less bleeding in comparison to the conventional technique with transillumination. Besides the advantages due to the tissue selective characteristics, the dissection takes place in considerably faster reducing the time, the procedure requires overall.</p>
                                             <p>Another advantage for both the patient and the surgeon is, that the procedure does not require drainage of the operation site by drainages and can be performed as an outpatient procedure.</p>

                                                Also known as micro-fat grafting, micronized injection, or Nano fat grafting, this procedure is a refined and specific technique of fat transfer, where a small amount of fat is removed and injected into other areas of the body. The word “Nano” or “micro” refers to the very small particles of fat that are specifically emulsified and used for areas with very defined contours, such as the fine lines, wrinkles, temples, tear troughs, dark circles around the eyes and other facial restoration. The best part of it is that it is an in office, very safe, easy, economical way to replace larger volume loss and can be precisely injected with a filler sized injection needle or cannula.

                                             <p>With the help of local anesthetic for ensure patient comfort, a small needle attached to a syringe is injected into an area with excess fat. Common areas may include the buttocks, abdomen, or flanks. After the fat is removed, it&rsquo;s spun in a centrifuge to separate the fat from other fluids. Then, the purified fat is injected into the delicate facial contours, depending on the patient&rsquo;s aesthetic goals.</p>

                                             <p>Blepharoplasty is currently defined as excision of excessive eyelid skin, with or without orbital fat, for either functional or cosmetic indications. Upper lid blepharoplasty may be performed in a traditional fashion, using stainless steel instruments, or may be modified with radiosurgery incisional techniques or laser incisional techniques. [1] In addition to standard suture techniques, tissue adhesives have also been used for skin closure.</p>
                                             <p>At the very beginning of the process,<strong> Dr.</strong><strong>Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> evaluates the periorbital aesthetic relationships before performing blepharoplasty surgery. Additionally, a basic ophthalmology examination, including testing visual acuity and testing for dry eyes, should be performed.</p>
                                             <p>Blepharoplasty may be performed as an isolated procedure or in combination with ptosis repair, or rejuvenation of the upper and lower face. In particular, the aging process affects the position of the forehead, brows, and cheek complex. These all contribute to the position and appearance of the eyelids.</p>
                                             <p>Actinic and degenerative changes of the facial skeletal and soft tissues lead to loss of elasticity of the skin, fat atrophy or redistribution, downward descent of the facial units, and rhytides. These features are all evaluated in the assessment of the upper eyelid and in the planning for surgical procedures to alter the periorbital tissue.</p>

                                             <p>The term &ldquo;lower blepharoplasty&rdquo; includes a collection of surgical techniques that aims to improve the appearance of the lower eyelids. Historically, lower blepharoplasty was a reductive procedure in which skin and/or fat was removed in order to reduce lower eyelid wrinkles, skin redundancy, and fat bulges. While fat and skin excision is still performed with modern lower Blepharoplasty , present trends follow a tissue-preserving philosophy that may include orbital and sub-orbicularis fat repositioning and fat transfer techniques to restore apparent volume loss associated with facial aging.</p>
                                             <p>There are a number of options for performing lower eyelid surgery:</p>
                                             <ul>
                                                <li>The traditional approach places the incision just below the eyelashes, trimming and/or repositioning excess skin and fat, and tightening the lower eyelid muscle.</li>
                                                <li>In the transconjunctival approach, effective in improving lower eyelid bags and puffiness, your surgeon places the incision inside the eyelid. Your surgeon can remove excess fat through a transconjunctival incision, but not excess skin.</li>
                                                <li>The &lsquo;skin pinch&rsquo; blepharoplasty removes only a bit of skin. This is effective if you have strong lower eyelid support and only a little extra skin. In some patients laser resurfacing can both tighten excess skin and remove wrinkles.</li>

                                    <p>Dark circles under the eyes can occur for several different reasons. They may happen as a result of a hollowness forming underneath the lower eyelid. This hollow groove (called the naso-jugal groove) forms as a natural result of tissue loss during the process of aging. We know that as people age, they lose fat, muscle and bone all over the face. Under the eyes is one of the first areas to show these changes. Shadows fall into the groove, causing the appearance of under eye dark circles. Bags under the eyes are caused by fatty tissue visibly protruding within the lower eyelid. Once again, a shadow falls into the groove underneath the bags and the person looks tired and older.</p>

                                    <h6>How to Treat Dark Circles Under the Eyes :</h6></b></p>
                                    <p>In the past the only remedy for bags under the eyes was an eyelid surgical procedure called blepharoplasty. This procedure involves removing or repositioning excess tissue through an eyelid incision. It carries all of the usual risks of surgery including bruising, swelling, scarring, eye damage, and anesthesia complications. When performed by an experienced and capable cosmetic, facial cosmetic or oculocosmetic surgeon, the results of surgical blepharoplasty are usually excellent. However, if results are not satisfactory, the procedure cannot be reversed. The other problem is, as we age, we lose the fat underneath our skin. Too often, ten years or so down the line, traditional blepharoplasty results in a sunken or hollow look, or eyelid skin that is too tight.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Dr.</strong><strong>Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> has created a non-invasive, safe and cost effective method to remedy dark circles and bags under the eyes without surgery. He uses an injectable filler to even out the plane beneath the eye, filling in the depression between the cheek and the eyelid. This eliminates the shadow, which creates the darkness, and improves the appearance of protruding lower lids.</p>

                                    <p>Anyone with pronounced aging in the temple area can benefit from this cosmetic surgery procedure. Women and men with heaviness and sagging in their forehead and brow are ideal candidates. Some patients just don&rsquo;t like the way their faces are changing around the eyes. In this case, and after discussing with <strong>Dr.</strong><strong>Tawfik Sefrioui</strong>, he can recommend a temple lift depending on the situation and patient&rsquo;s needs.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Dr.</strong><strong>Tawfik Sefrioui</strong>, performs temple lifts on an outpatient basis under general or local anesthesia, either in a free-standing surgical center or in the cosmetic Surgery One office.</p>
                                    <p>To begin the procedure, he places an incision entirely in the hairline above the ear. Through this incision the underlying tissue is tightened, crow&rsquo;s feet lines can be addressed, and the skin tightened, trimming off the excess. This lift also may be done to improve on an old eyelid procedure or to complement an eyelid procedure when there is excessive heaviness in the lateral brow. Drains are rarely used, but may be needed overnight at most.
                                    </p>

                                       Most patients report virtually no pain with their procedure and the sutures are removed in 7 to 10 days. Because of the inconspicuous suture locations made entirely within the hair, many people can return to work well before the sutures are removed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>Nowadays patients need to be well informed about the art of Rhinoplasty and the different approaches of it within a matter of hours.</p>
                                    <p>Despite this, there is still a shortage of information regarding rhinoplasty and the various approaches rhinoplasty surgeons use to improve a patient&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Little distinction and attention is given to it:</strong></p>
                                    <p>There are two main ways in which surgery can be performed, and this very lack of information can easily lead a future rhinoplasty patient into having a more traumatic and unnecessary surgery if she doesn&rsquo;t do enough homework.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Scarless rhinoplasty&rdquo;,</strong> is a unique surgery whereby corrections and enhancements of the nose are made internally through the nostrils, avoid the need to inflict a scar at the bottom of the nose. Enhancing and beautifying the nose without visible scarring and done under local anesthesia.</p>
                                    <p>Most patients recover very quickly, the following day which is important, because statistically speaking these patients are young, energetic, and very social. This enables them to perform activities of daily living usually on post-operative day two. most patients don&rsquo;t show evidence of having had surgery and this accommodates the needs for busy patients who need to return to work, school, and can&rsquo;t take extended time away from their responsibilities. <strong>Scarless surgery</strong> coupled with decreased healing times, are a few of the many advantages of having closed nasal surgery.</p>
                                    <p>In general, most rhinoplasty surgeons offer open approaches to their patients. Very few surgeons in the world perform only scarless rhinoplasty&rdquo; but the overall benefits of scarless surgery overshadow the risks of any other approach.</p>
                                    <p>Surgeons are only being taught how to do open Rhinoplasty which is unfortunate since the majority of patients having surgery are ideal candidates for scarless rhinoplasty but don&rsquo;t realize that this is even an option.</p>
                                    <p>For that reason and because of lack of information the option would unequivocally make the patient choose the scarless approach one hundred percent of the time. If given the opportunity, most women would not accept scarring, prolonged swelling, and bruising if they were told other options were available.</p>

                                    <h6>Advantages of Scarless Rhinoplasty</h6></b></p>
                                    <p><strong>1- No Scarring:</strong> The chief advantage of scarless rhinoplasty is the fact that it leaves no disfiguring scar across the columella.</p>
                                    <p><strong>2- Shorter Recovery:</strong> By not damaging the columella, the nasal tissues will heal more quickly.</p>
                                    <p><strong>3- Reduced Swelling:</strong> Swelling diminishes more quickly with scarless rhinoplasty than with open rhinoplasty.</p>
                                    <p><strong>4-Significant Improvements:</strong> scarless rhinoplasty can make significant improvements to the structure and appearance of the nose.</p>
                                    <p>In a personal consultation, your doctor will evaluate the overall appearance of your nose, its symmetry and how it fits in with the rest of your facial features. Many times the doctor will find that only a minor adjustment is required since other areas, such as the chin or cheeks, reflect the the perception of nasal proportion. Nasal Refinement, also called rhinoplasty, is typically performed to reduce the overall size of the nose, reshape a tip, remove a nasal hump or improve a poor angle between the nose and the upper lip.</p>
                                    <p>Newer Scarless techniques of nasal sculpturing permit to help resolving the imperfections of your nose under local anesthesia with minimum downtime.</p>

Depending on your problem, we can help you decide what approach is best for your individualized needs. Often, the cheek implant is performed at the time of eyelid surgery or a facelift and can be inserted through the eyelid incision or through an incision in the mouth. The implants are secured to the underlying bone and produce an immediate effect and beautiful, long lasting augmentation.</p>

                                    <p>The cheek lift, or midface lift, by percutaneous cheek suspension is a new minimally invasive procedure designed to lift the cheek and midface region. The percutaneous cheek lift can improve the appearance of nasolabial folds, sagging of the cheeks and midface, and prominent lower eye sockets in order to provide a more youthful appearance.</p>
                                    <p>Individuals who are looking for a minimally invasive solution for sagging of the cheeks and lower eye area and/or nasolabial folds may be good candidates for a percutaneous cheek lift. As with all cosmetic surgery, it&rsquo;s also important that patients be physically healthy and have expectations that are realistic. The percutaneous cheek lift procedure cannot provide the same dramatic results as a full facelift but is ideal for younger patients seeking a less invasive option. During your consultation, Dr. Donath will examine your face and help you to decide if a midface lift with percutaneous cheek suspension is the best option to address your needs.</p>
                                    <p>The percutaneous cheek lift can be performed in the office setting with minimal sedation. Dr. Donath will begin by making hidden incisions located within the hairline at the temple. Suture loops are then placed through the incisions under the skin of the midface and are used to elevate the cheek fat pads. Recovery after the percutaneous cheek lift is generally mild and rapid. Some swelling and bruising may occur but these side effects fade quickly. Discomfort is typically minimal.</p>

                                    <p>A slim, elegant neckline is a key component in the overall facial profile. Excess fat or loose skin in the neck area can develop at any age, whether as a result of mild weight gain or simple genetics. Neck liposuction is a simple and effective procedure that can help create a beautiful, natural-looking neck line in people who have a mild amount of excess fat or slight skin laxity in the neck.* Neck liposuction can be particularly beneficial for younger patients, between the ages of 20 and 40, who typically have better skin tightening capacity. Patients in their 50s and 60s may also benefit from neck liposuction, although when there is significant skin laxity present, a neck lift may be a better option. <strong>Dr.</strong><strong>Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> uses a combination of traditional and laser liposuction to help bring about substantial results in both fat reduction and tissue tightening.* Fat is gently removed from the neck, while the heat from the laser stimulates the body&rsquo;s natural healing mechanisms to encourage collagen remodeling and skin tightening</p>

                                    <p>Some people are frustrated by what is commonly referred to as a double chin. There are some common features that contribute to the appearance of a double chin. Patients may have a combination of the following, and usually inherit these features from their parents:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                       <li>A lax platysma muscle</li>
                                       <li>Excess fat in the neck area</li>
                                       <li>A recessive chin</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Patients with any combination of these features may be candidates for a double chin surgery. Double chin surgery is appropriate for younger patients under the age of 40 who don&rsquo;t have any lower face or neck skin laxity. Patients over the age of 40 typically have lower face laxity that would render double chin surgery ineffective. Patients over the age of 40 who have a poor neck angle or double chin are typical candidates for lower facelift for surgery.</p>

                                    <p>Ears that protrude prominently can be the cause of much dissatisfaction, and even great unhappiness for men and women who experience this condition. Prominent ear correction/reshaping, also known as Otoplasty, is a surgical solution that can produce significant change in one&rsquo;s appearance, and is considered one of the most successful cosmetic surgery procedures.</p>
                                    <p>The primary objective is to reduce the protrusion of the ears, and to provide a normal configuration when the ear is viewed from the side. This is achieved by modifying the flexibility of the cartilage of the ear, thereby altering the shape and position to a more desirable appearance.</p>
                                    <p>The procedure may be performed under either local anaesthetic with sedation, and usually takes around one hour, and is performed as a ambulatory surgery.</p>
                                    <p>Men and women of all ages may benefit from prominent ear correction. By achieving a better relationship between your ears and your face, prominent ear correction can improve your appearance and increase your self-confidence.</p>
                                    <p>At the time of your consultation at the Office, Dr Tawfik will discuss the various options available to you, in line with your specific medical circumstances. You should always feel free to ask your surgeon any questions that you have regarding the surgery, and discuss any areas that may seem unclear. The goal of your surgeon and the our Staff is to make your entire experience as comfortable, and worry-free.</p>

                                    <p>A double chin or sagging neck may be due to fat accumulation in the neck and chin area. Fat deposits in these areas can be caused by heredity, weight gain or the natural aging process. These traits are often resistant to weight loss and exercise. Facial liposuction involves the removal of specific areas of localized fat deposits in the neck and jaw area. It is performed on an outpatient basis and takes approximately one hour. Facial Liposuction, or a neck lift, can help to restore a more youthful appearance.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui</strong> is one of the pioneers in the field of facial fat grafting. As one of the first surgeons in the world to combine facelift procedures with large volume fat grafting, Dr. Tawfik recognized the need to restore deep and superficial fat compartment and facial volume with fat grafting. Dr. Tawfik work provided his patients for using larger volumes of fat for replacement of lost soft tissue from aging, along with the use of fat derived stem cells and regenerative cells called enhanced fat for restoring vascularity to the aging face and reversing some of the aging changes in elastin and collagen fibers, the hallmark of aging. Fat and its component cells are now routinely used in our practice to replace and regenerate aging facial tissues.</p>
                                    <p>Many operative techniques are used for the fat transfer among which the <strong>FAMI</strong> Technique, The <strong>Almi</strong> Technique, the <strong>Nano -Fat</strong> with stem cells, The Snif and the micronized fat transfer.</p>
                                    <p>For the Beautification, Regeneration and Rejuvenation of the Facial Skin we usually associated our facial fat transfer with Stem-cell facial Rejuvenation using Fat mesenchymal stem-cells using the latest Technology, or Sterile Lab on the OR Table, the procedure to process the stem-cells lasts 40 minutes getting you at least 5 millions of stem-cells just by mechanical separation, we provide with a report from our cell counter.</p>
                                    <p>This Stem-cells are delivered by the latest Technology called <strong>DERMAPHRAC</strong> which combines micro needling, microdermabrasion and LED Therapy.</p>
